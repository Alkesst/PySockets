# PySockets
Adaptation of a practice for the subject Networks and Distributed Systems
made with python 3.x using the socket library.

### Objective
A client, or clients, that sends to a server a message with an offset, whose response is the 
cyphered message using the [Caesar cypher method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).
Also learning socket programming with python 3.x (y subir algo la nota de la asignatura no creen)



#### Notes
The server only listens to the 12345 port.

You can find a little document with a comparison between Java sockets and Python Sockets [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dAZm8AK7vR8rRWpfW2o_YgxK9XGOSsHs71B6UeDFHvw/edit?usp=sharing)
